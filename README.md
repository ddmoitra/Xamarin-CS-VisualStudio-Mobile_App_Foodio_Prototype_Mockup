### Title

* Xamarin C# Visual Studio - Mobile App Foodio UI/UX Prototype

### About / Synopsis

* The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the potential of the Xamarin framework and prototype mock screens of an online ordering business (Foodio) on Android mobile devices (Galaxy phone, Pixel tablet) using C# programming language within Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

### Detailed Description 

* The Xamarin Shell is set up and Foodio's XAML along with corresponding C# class code. A Flyout application is chosen in this case to demonstrate ease of navigation.


* The Foodio prototype is deployed into the Android devices including a Galaxy phone and a Pixel tablet


* The flyout navigation menu demonstrates the custom list elements "Lunch" and "Dinner" along with custom icon resources


* Upon making a selection the flyout menu reveals the tabbed pages further subdividing each custom list element items without having the user scroll down for a long time to get to desired item, thus improving user experience by organizing options more easily. This is seen across the devices.


* The C# code files for Windows, Android and iOS have been included, showing how by programming in one language, the Xamarin framework can help developers build napplications across multiple plaforms
